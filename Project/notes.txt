1. use full mode instead? no safety shutdown
2. start timer only  after serial is initialized , etc
3. on BS , send all bytes of a command in a single packet & do same at robot? how? uartstream packet instead of byte
4. cant drive for 1 sec? since have to fire timer, but meanwhile, other items will still be dequeued and more commands sent?
test by sending move forward , then move right
5. this entire is shit, 1 packet per opcode, so even if 1 packet lost , everything lost

6. for rssi, every node needs to exchange messages, not just to BS,
else only BS will know where it is in ref to other motes, but other motes wont.
So every mote at the start needs to find out what rssi it is from other motes and send to BS, so BS can determine coordinate system

7. so, on every mote, we not only need rssi code, but, also to receive from other motes and forward to BS

8. BS receives RSSI messages for itself, and & also modified rssi data collation from other motes, & sensor message once & irbotomsg?

9. irobot receives rssi from others, collate info & send to BS
irobot receives irobotmsg as command to move or sing

10. how do i multiplex multiple amsend with the same radio?

11. fn to turn by degrees
